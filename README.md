# covid19_data_analysis
### Data source statement
* All the dataset analized in this report are downloaded from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data
* Totally there are 5 csv files:
  * time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv
  * time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv
  * time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
  * time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
  * UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv
* Why choose downloading those datasets instead of importing them directly from web.
  * Because I'm based in China where usually failed to access the data from web in R
  * As the COVID19 pandemic is over, I think those data will not get updated anymore and the data I downloaded will be up-to-date.
  
  
### Objective statment
* Follow the instructions in the course of Data Science as a Field on the Cousera.org to learn how to tidy, visualize and analyze COVID19 data.
* Besides the comparison between China and the US, only small modification between my version of processes and those mentioned in the course.
* The biggest difference is that I got the complete version of dataset because the pandemic was over years ago. In contrast, the professor only got portion of the whole data when she recorded that course during the pandemic in 2021.
* So even I almost copy the processes from the course, as I got more data, the results in my report should be more accurate. For example, we can only get the states in the US doing the best or the worst during the whole pandemic after the pandemic.
